# LinksDapp

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I noticed LinksDAO didn't have a feature that welcomed the addition of their new Champion NFTs, so I created functionality that displays all the champions you own in your wallet so the user can admire their collection while getting great deals and promtions with their LinksDAO membership.
